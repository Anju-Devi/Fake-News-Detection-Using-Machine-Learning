Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anju, an engineering student diving into my first hands-on Machine Learning project. If you're a beginner like me, don't worryâ€”Iâ€™ll walk you through it step by step!

Hereâ€™s How to Get Started
Install Anaconda

First things first, download and install Anaconda on your system. Itâ€™s a super helpful tool to manage packages and environments for Python.
Once installed, open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.
Download the Dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subho117/fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning)
Go to this Kaggle dataset and download the dataset. Itâ€™s the foundation of our project!
Upload the Dataset to Jupyter Notebook

Upload the dataset to Jupyter Notebook. Itâ€™s easy and makes it all ready for your code.
Create a New Notebook

Now, create a new file in Jupyter Notebook (name it something like fake_news_detection.ipynb).
Run the Code

Copy the code from the fake_news_detection.ipynb file and run it line by line. If you get stuck or see any errors, donâ€™t panicâ€”just copy the error and search for solutions online (or ask me!). ChatGPT and Stack Overflow are great places to find fixes. ðŸ˜„
Results

After running the code, youâ€™ll see the magic happen! The fake news detection model will give you results.
A Quick Recap
This project is all about detecting fake news using machine learning. Itâ€™s a perfect starting point for beginners, so feel free to tweak and experiment with the code as you go!

Good luck, and have fun learning! ðŸš€
