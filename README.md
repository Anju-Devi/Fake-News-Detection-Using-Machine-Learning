# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete pipeline for building and deploying a **Fake News Detection** model. The project uses Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

### üìÇ Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loads data, removes unnecessary columns, and preprocesses text.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations using Seaborn and WordCloud.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text to numeric features.
- **Model Training**: Trains models like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for binary classification.
- **Evaluation**: Compares model accuracy and displays the confusion matrix.

### üîç Features
- **Preprocessing**: Removes stopwords, punctuations, and performs tokenization.
- **Visualization**: Word clouds and bar charts for understanding word frequency.
- **Modeling**: Train and test models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) for fake news detection.
- **Prediction Function**: A simple function to predict if a news article is real or fake.

### üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anju-Devi/Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning.git
